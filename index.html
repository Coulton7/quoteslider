                          <p>I joined AESSEAL速 in 2013 straight from university as a Business Assurance Officer (HSEQ).
                          I began with a focus on H&S where AESSEAL速 put me through my NEBOSH General Certificate which is an in depth qualification
                          built as a foundation for Health and Safety Managers. I progressed into Quality and Environmental aspects of the department
