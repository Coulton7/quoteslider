                      <p>I joined AESSEAL® in 1987 as Data Input Clerk. Two years later I was offered promotion to Accounts Supervisor which gave me responsibility of my own team and the output of the department.</p>
                      <p>My next promotion took me into our Stores department as Stores Manager. The role included an increase in staff responsibility, stock control, and mechanical seal assembly and to make sure customer orders were despatched on time.</p>
                      <p>In 1995 I was promoted to the IT and Payroll Manager. In 2012 I’m still in the IT Department as IT Manager. My main responsibility is to provide support for our Global ERP Systems and the ongoing development. I also provide support to our IT Director with the day to day running of the IT Department.</p>
                      <p>During my 30 year career at AESSEAL®  I have been given the opportunity to be the best I can be and to know I have contributed to a successful company. AESSEAL® gave me the opportunity to complete an Open University Course in Management and I’ve had the chance to travel to many of our Global sites and experience different cultures.</p>

                          <p>I started my apprenticeship in October 2013. In the first year I worked at the AMRC training center learning machining techniques with a day a week at
                           college doing an engineering BTEC.</p>
                          <p>After this I began working in the Test house as an Apprentice Test Engineer where I was a member of the Gas Seal Team, lapping, etching, building and testing
                           Compressor Dry Gas Seals and Universal Dry Gas Seals. During this time I completed a Mechanical Engineering HNC and HND as day release.</p>
                          <p>In 2017 I joined the customer order design team where I learnt to use solid edge to design seals to suit the customer’s requirements. I then progressed to the gas
                           seal design team and I am doing a degree partially funded by AESSEAL.</p>
                          <p>I would recommend the apprentice program to others because there is a lot of opportunities to work within different departments, gain experience and progress through the company.</p>

                          <p>I joined AESSEAL® in 2013 straight from university as a Business Assurance Officer (HSEQ).
                          I began with a focus on H&S where AESSEAL® put me through my NEBOSH General Certificate which is an in depth qualification
                          built as a foundation for Health and Safety Managers. I progressed into Quality and Environmental aspects of the department
                          completing formal qualifications in both disciplines.</p>
                          <p>AESSEAL® nurtured my developing management skills over a 12 month period before I was formally appointed as the UK Business
                           Assurance Manager.</p>
                            <p>I am now completing a NEBOSH Diploma in my own time, which I will finish this year. This Diploma is an evidence based qualifications
                             for Health and Safety Managers – which I certainly could not have achieved without the management opportunity that AESSEAL® has given me.</p>
                            <p>I also get to visit sites across the Global Business carrying out audits, training and implementing ISO systems.
                            For a large company to trust in a young person to represent the AESSEAL® brand around the Globe is definitely something most other Companies do not offer.
                            I have only spent a relatively short time with AESSEAL® and the first 4 years of employment have been fast paced, challenging but certainly rewarding and
                            I look forward to developing my career further within the Company.</p>
